          Daksh is an annual education and career fair conducted and organised by the Student Council and is the Student Council's 
          flagship event. This event provides a platform for all the students to explore the various career options available to 
          them at CHRIST (Deemed to be University). Each department across the campus sets up stalls displaying the various 
          programmes that their department has to offer.  Various career dialogues by eminent personalities are conducted 
          during this two-day event so as to provide students with an in depth understanding on how various careers look like in 
          real life. These career dialogues are delivered by experts in various fields. The Student Council also developed an app 
          called "Accord" during the academic year 2018-19 to ease the process of registrations during Daksh which made registrations 
          hassle free and paperless and also recorded the interests of various individuals who would visit various stalls in order to 
          develop a better understanding of where the interest of students lie.

          for the Security, Housekeeping Staff, Gardeners, Non-teaching staff and Administration staff to have a fun and leisure 
          time. A small token of appreciation is also handed over to all of them by the students. This fun week is concluded by
